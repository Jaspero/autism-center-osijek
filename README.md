# Autism Center Osijek
This is the full source code for the Autism Center Osijek.
The app is built in [Sapper](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper) and the database and hosting is on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). 

Content management is done through [JMS](https://github.com/Jaspero/jms) our open source content management system. 

## Why is this open source 

Jaspero benefits greatly from the open source community. This app in its entirety is made possible because of open source software. Because of this we try to open source as many of our projects as we can. 

We don't have the required manpower and experties to build frameworks and tools the community could directly use in building awesome software, so by open sourcing our projects we hope people can find inspiration or code snippets to speed up development.
